     * control for this request (for instance, trying to change the virtual host to which a Request
     * should be sent from a pipeline attached to a Host or Context in the standard implementation).

     * next Valve in the pipeline.
     * <li>Consume bytes from the input stream associated with the Request, unless it is completely
     * generating the response, or wrapping the request before passing it on.

     * method has returned.
